URL Shortener Microservice
==========================

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: [https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks](https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks). Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

*   Clone [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener/) and complete your project locally.
*   Use [our Gitpod starter project](https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener/) to complete your project. Learn [how to share your Gitpod workspace to get help](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-use-gitpod-in-the-curriculum/668669#how-can-i-share-my-workspace-to-get-help-8).
*   Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

**HINT:** Do not forget to use a body parsing middleware to handle the POST requests. Also, you can use the function `dns.lookup(host, cb)` from the `dns` core module to verify a submitted URL.

Tests
-----

1\. You should provide your own project, not the example URL.

2\. You can POST a URL to `/api/shorturl` and get a JSON response with `original_url` and `short_url` properties. Here's an example: `{ original_url : 'https://freeCodeCamp.org', short_url : 1}`

3\. When you visit `/api/shorturl/<short_url>`, you will be redirected to the original URL.

4\. If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http://www.example.com` format, the JSON response will contain `{ error: 'invalid url' }`
